        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger, with its juice</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons grated or smashed gralic (from about 3 cloves)</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li> 4 skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds), deboned, cut into 2 inch chunks</li>
            <li> Peanut oil, or a mixture of peanut and canola or safflower, for frying</li>
            <li> 1 cup potato starch (katakuriko)</li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li> Lemon wedge, for serving</li>
            <li> Lettuce and cucumber slices, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the chicken, combine ginger,
                garlic, sake, soy sauce, and sugar. Toss chicken pieces in marinade to coat.
                Cover and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Fill an aluminum or thin stainless steel pot (best for quick temperature adjustments),
                with sides at least 5 inches tall, with about 3 inches of peanut oil. Heat the oil to
                350 degrees. Place several layers of newsprint or paper towels on a sheet pan.
            </li>
            <li>While the oil heats, place a wire rack over a second sheet pan. In a bowl, combine
                potato starch, salt, and pepper. Remove one piece of chicken at a time from marinade, 
            and tuck in any jagged bits or skin as you roll it in starch mixture to coat. Rest it on the 
            rack. Repeat with all chicken pieces. </li>
            <li>Gently shake off excess potato starch before cooking each piece of chicken. Fry 3 or 4
                pieces at a time, keeping oil temperature around 325 degrees (temperature will fall when you
                add chicken) and no lower than 300 degrees. Fry for about 3 minutes, or until golden. Remove
                from oil using a wire-mesh spoon or long chopsticks, and cool on newsprint or paper towels. 
            </li>
            <li>When all the chicken has been fried once, increase the oil's temperature to 375 degrees. Fry
                chicken pieces a second time, keeping the oil between 350 and 375 degrees, until the crust
                is deep golden brown, about 1 minute. Drain on newsprint or paper towels. This second frying makes
                the coating stay extra crisp, even if you don't serve it immediately. 
            </li>
            <li>Serve hot or at room temperature, with a lemon wedge, and lettuce and cucumber slices for a cool,
                fresh contrast, if you like.
            </li>
        </ol>
