        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is adapted from <em>Nobu: The Cookbook</em>, which I received as a present
            many years ago after I visited Nobu's restaurant and swooned over the omakase tasting
            menu. It's very simple dish; there is some advanced preparation, but's easy and quick!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1/4 cup sake</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mirin</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup white miso paste</li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li> 4 (8-ounce) black cod fillets</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Two to 3 days beforehand, make the miso marinade and marinate the fish.</strong>
                Bring the sake and mirin to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Boil for 20 seconds 
                to evaporate the alcohol. Turn the heat down to low, add the miso paste, and whisk. 
                When the miso has dissolved completely, turn the heat up to high again and add the
                sugar, whisking constantly to ensure that the sugar doesn't burn on the bottom of
                the pan. Remove from heat once the sugar is fully dissolved. Cool to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>Pat the black cod fillets thoroughly dry with paper towels. Slather the fish with the
                miso marinade and place in a non-reactive dish or bowl and cover tightly with plastic 
                wrap. Leave to marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.
            </li>
            <li><strong>To cook the fish:</strong> Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Heat an oven-proof skillet over high heat on 
                the stovetop. Lightly wipe off any excess miso clinging to the fillets, but don't rinse 
                it off. Film the pan with a little oil, then place the fish skin-side-up on the pan and 
                cook until the bottom of the fish browns and blackens in spots, about 3 minutes. Flip and 
                continue cooking until the other side is browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the oven 
                and bake for 5 to 10 minutes, until fish is opaque and flakes easily.
